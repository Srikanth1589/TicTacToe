# How to play the game (WIP)

Starts this way:

Board as of now
-------------
|   |   |   |

1. Player's turn: Enter the number on the board (0-8)
2. Enter a number between 0-8 and press enter
3. If you enter a number which already has an entry, you will see this `Position already filled. Choose a different number on the board (0-8)`
4. If you enter a number which is out of range (0-8), yu will see this `Wrong number. Enter the number on the board (0-8)`


### Adjustments needed
1. Creating a tossing system to check which player goes first `X` or `O`
2. Make the program efficient
